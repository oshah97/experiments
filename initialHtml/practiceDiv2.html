&#9827 Description:

This is an HTML file that serves as a place to practice formatting two adjacent div's. The left div only contains text and constitutes 70% of the window width. The right div contains a table and constitutes 25% of the window width. The challenge is to maintain the shape of the table (within the right div) as well as the its width proportional to the left div as the window is being resized.

&#9827 Learned &/or Implemented:

Adding a scoll function into the table would allow the shape of the table to be maintained as the window is being resized. To do this, overflow: auto was added to the styling of the div that contains the table (.tableTest).

The next function that was added was an event function that registered when the window was being resized and prints "Window Has Been Resized" message in the console log. To implement this, a jQuery function was created that to watch for a window resizing event.
